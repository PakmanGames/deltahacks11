# Memory Lane - Deltahacks 11

## üåü Inspiration
- Each year, millions of people worldwide suffer from early-onset Alzheimer's and dementia.  
- These conditions not only result in significant financial costs for medication and treatment but also take an emotional toll on families and impact overall well-being.  
- Research shows that cognitive stimulation can significantly delay the progression of these diseases.  
- This inspired us to create **Memory Lane**, a tool designed to empower individuals with memory impairments and improve their quality of life.  

## üè° What it Does
**Memory Lane** is a user-friendly Streamlit-based web application.  
Our product serves as a virtual assistant equipped with a camera to recognize and identify the faces of people you interact with.  
### Key Features:
1. **Capture Memories**: Upload a picture of someone, add their name and a short description.  
2. **Instant Recognition**: The app ensures that this person is recognized in every future interaction.  
3. **Personalized Descriptions**: Provides memory cues to help users connect with their loved ones effortlessly.  

## ‚öíÔ∏è How We Built It
- **Frontend**: Developed with Streamlit for an intuitive, interactive user interface.  
- **Backend**: Integrated powerful technologies like OpenCV and face_recognition to detect and recognize faces.  
- **Deployment**: Ensured seamless communication and real-time functionality using tools like WebRTC and Socket.IO.  

## ‚öì Challenges We Ran Into
1. Resolving compatibility issues between dependencies like WebRTC, Socket.IO, and Streamlit.  
2. Learning and implementing new technologies, which required adapting to emerging frameworks.  
3. Managing our time effectively, coordinating schedules, and meeting soft deadlines amidst a high-paced hackathon environment.  

## ü•á Accomplishments We‚Äôre Proud Of
- **Innovative Idea**: Identifying a meaningful problem and crafting a solution that resonated deeply with our team and the audience.  
- **Overcoming Hurdles**: Successfully integrating complex technologies despite initial challenges.  
- **Collaboration**: Working as a team to brainstorm, develop, and deliver a polished product within the tight time constraints.  

## üìù What We Learned
